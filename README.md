# BioinformaticsFinalProject-GeneExpressionAnalysisOfTNBCNon-TNBCAndHER2BreastCancerTypes
A gene expression analysis of breast cancer comparing three different types of cancers: Triple Negative, Non-Triple Negative and HER2
I recommend you start reading the Results section in the PDF file named “Gene expression analysis of TNBC, Non-TNBC, and HER2 breast cancer types” for better understanding of the project.
